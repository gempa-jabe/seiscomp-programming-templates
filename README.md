# SeisComP programming templates

This repository consists of some SeisComP programming templates
for various concepts such as plugins for amplitudes, magnitudes, scevent
and other interfaces.

The codes do not provide any meaningful functions. They are only provided
as templates. You have to add the functionality you need for your project.

Each level1 directory can be included in the SeisComP source tree under,
e.g. `src/extras/<dir>` and compiled along with SeisComP.
